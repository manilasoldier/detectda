.. py:exception:: HomologyError

   Bases: :py:obj:`Exception`


   Raised when homology for a given dimension is insufficient for calculating some quantity


.. py:exception:: TrivialImageError

   Bases: :py:obj:`Exception`


   Common base class for all non-exit exceptions.


.. py:class:: ImageSeries(video, polygon=None, div=1, n_jobs=None)

   Bases: :py:obj:`VidPol`


   Reads in an image series (video), either a single or multiple frames.

   May optionally specify polygonally region, held constant across frames,
   in which to select specific generators in persistent homology.

   :param video: Image series. Index on axis=0 represents the frame index, unless a single image (2d array) is provided.
   :type video: array_like
   :param polygon: Polygonal region outside of which positive cells of 0th persistent homology will be excluded.
   :type polygon: shapely.Polygon, optional, default is ``None``
   :param div: In nanoparticle imaging process, pixel intensities are often registered as something close to a(div),
               so dividing by div and rounding to nearest integer will give pixel intensities that conform more strongly
               to common parametric assumptions.
   :type div: positive int/float, optional, default is ``1``.
   :param n_jobs: The number of jobs to use for the computation. ``None`` means 1 unless
                  in a :obj:`joblib.parallel_backend` context. ``-1`` means using all
                  processors.
   :type n_jobs: int or None, optional, default is ``None``


   .. py:method:: alps_plot(frames)

   .. py:method:: fit(sigma=None, max_death_pixel_int=True, print_time=True)

      Fit method for ImageSeries object.

      Optional Gaussian smoothing with sigma parameter.

      The argument max_death_pixel_int controls whether or not
      the maximum death time is the largest pixel value (within an image),
      or the largest finite death time (within an image).

      Get persistent entropy of each image frame from fitted object. For hypothesis testing
      purposes, the default is negative of the entropy

   but with enhanced functionality for utilizing BOTH 0- and 1-dimensional persistent homology.
